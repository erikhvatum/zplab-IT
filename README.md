# zplab-IT
This repository contains WUSTL ZPLAB IT (Information Technology) protocol and procedure documentation in GitHub Markdown format,
in addition to home-grown scripts and other resources referred to by the documentation.

#### ZPLAB has lots of repositories. What is different about this one?
This repository contains information about configuring and maintaining computers in ZPLAB, with a focus on proceedures for production
laboratory Linux systems. Some of these specify installing the scripts, libraries, source code, and other things found in ZPLAB
repositories such as [rpc-scope](https://github.com/zplab/rpc-scope) and [zplib](https://github.com/zplab/zplib). So, this repository
isn't a thing that is installed or upgraded, but it does contain instructions and resources to facilitate installing, upgrading,
and otherwise maintaining lab systems and software.
